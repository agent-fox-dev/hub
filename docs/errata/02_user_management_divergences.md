# Errata: Spec 02 (OAuth and Users) — User Management Divergences

This document records divergences between spec 02 (oauth_and_users) and the
implemented codebase or other specs, discovered during task group 2 (user
management tests).

## 1. team_memberships Missing `role` Column

**Spec 02 says (02-REQ-6.1):** GET /api/v1/users/:id returns
`team_memberships` array with `{team_id, team_name, role}` per entry.
Test TS-02-19 asserts `role == 'member'`.

**Reality:** The `team_members` table (defined in spec 01 DDL and owned by
spec 03) has only columns: `team_id`, `user_id`, `created_at`. There is no
`role` column. Spec 03 explicitly lists "Roles within teams" as
deferred/out-of-scope.

**Adaptation:** The handler must JOIN `team_members` with `teams` to populate
`team_id` and `team_name`. For the `role` field, the handler should return
`"member"` as a hardcoded default until spec 03 adds role support. The test
checks for the presence of the `role` field without asserting a specific
value, with a comment noting this limitation.

**Affected requirements:** 02-REQ-6.1, TS-02-19.

## 2. full_name NOT NULL Constraint vs Null Semantics

**Spec 02 says (02-REQ-7.1):** PUT /api/v1/users/:id should set `full_name`
to null if the supplied value is null or empty string.

**Spec 01 DDL:** `full_name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` — the NOT NULL constraint
makes it impossible to store NULL in the `full_name` column.

**Adaptation:** When the request supplies null or an empty string for
`full_name`, the handler stores an empty string (`''`) instead of SQL NULL.
API responses return `""` (empty string) rather than JSON `null` for a
cleared full_name. Tests adapted to assert empty string instead of null.

**Affected requirements:** 02-REQ-7.1, TS-02-20.

## 3. Case-Insensitive Username Uniqueness

**Spec 02 says (02-REQ-12.2):** Username uniqueness is enforced by comparing
lowercased forms. Usernames are stored as-is (case preserved).

**Spec 01 DDL:** `username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE` — SQLite's UNIQUE constraint
on TEXT columns is case-sensitive by default.

**Adaptation:** The implementation must enforce case-insensitive uniqueness
at the application level before every INSERT/UPDATE. The handler should query
`SELECT id FROM users WHERE LOWER(username) = LOWER(?)` before inserting.
A future DDL migration could add `COLLATE NOCASE` to the column or create a
functional unique index on `LOWER(username)` for race-condition safety.

**Affected requirements:** 02-REQ-12.2, 02-REQ-4.4, TS-02-16, TS-02-38,
TS-02-E15.

## 4. Key Refresh Expiry Duration Calculation

**Spec 02 says (02-REQ-9.1, 02-REQ-9.4):** POST /api/v1/keys/:key_id/refresh
reuses the "original expiry duration" to recalculate expires_at.

**Problem:** The `api_keys` table has no `expires_in_days` column. The task
plan computes original duration as `ceil((expires_at - created_at) / 24h)`,
which only works on the first refresh. After refresh, `expires_at` is
updated but `created_at` remains the original value, causing the computed
duration to grow on each subsequent refresh.

**Adaptation:** The implementation should either:
(a) Add an `expires_in_days` INTEGER column to the `api_keys` table, or
(b) Store the original duration at key creation time and retrieve it at
    refresh time using a different mechanism (e.g., compute from the FIRST
    expires_at and created_at, before any refreshes).

Option (b) is viable if the handler stores the original N value in a new
column or computes it from the initial state. This is deferred to the
implementation task groups (5, 8).

**Affected requirements:** 02-REQ-9.1, 02-REQ-9.4, TS-02-27, TS-02-28,
TS-02-30.
